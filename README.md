# VisiableAnalysis
## Cesium Visibility of Two Points
### Main ideas
The AnalysisTool.js describe that how to confirm two points is visiable or not in the terrain scene.
First,get the start_point and stop_point coordinates, and then obtain a series of linear points by interpolation.
Second,calculate the actual elevation value of each coordinate point.
Finally, compare the results and visiualization.
