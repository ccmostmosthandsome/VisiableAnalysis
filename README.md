# VisiableAnalysis
## Cesium Visibility of Two Points
### Main ideas
The AnalysisTool.js describe that how to confirm two points is visiable or not in the terrain scene. <br />
First,get the start_point and stop_point coordinates, and then obtain a series of linear points by interpolation. <br />
Second,calculate the actual elevation value of each coordinate point. <br />
Finally, compare the results and visiualization. <br />
